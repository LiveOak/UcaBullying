### Abstract
> According to the compensation model of aggression (Staub, 1989), some people bully to defend against their own feelings of weakness and vulnerability. Classmates and teachers rated a sample of American 6th graders in terms of trait: defensiveness (i.e., defensive egotism), self-esteem, bullying, and related behaviors. Consistent with the compensation model, peer- and teacher-rated defensive egotism was positively associated with bullying and with physical and social aggression, respectively. Low peer-rated self-esteem was linked with bully victimization, whereas high peer-rated self-esteem was associated with defending victims. Findings were generally qualified, however, by regression analyses that examined personality, gender, and their interaction as predictors of the focal behaviors. For example, the positive association between defensive egotism and bullying held only for boys. Overall, these findings suggest that bullying-reduction programs in schools should place greater emphasis on the personality and motivational dynamics of the key playersâ€”bullies, victims, and victim defenders.
